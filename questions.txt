What's the difference between something being undefined as opposed
to returning an error? i.e pyton returning errors when js would go undefined.
Advantages/disadvantages?


def __init__(self, start=0):
        """Make a serial number generator starting at start."""
        self.start = self.next = start

    def generate(self):
        """I don't understand why we - 1 here"""
        self.next += 1
        return self.next - 1

    def reset(self):
        """Reset generator back to start."""
        self.next = self.start
